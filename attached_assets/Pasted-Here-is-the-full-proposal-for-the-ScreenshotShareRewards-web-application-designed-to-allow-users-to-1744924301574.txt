Here is the full proposal for the ScreenshotShareRewards web application, designed to allow users to upload screenshot images, earn dynamic rewards in XNO (a cryptocurrency or token), and share content virally. This proposal details all features, reward mechanisms, and technical requirements to ensure the platform is ready for live implementation.
ScreenshotShareRewards: Full Proposal
Overview
ScreenshotShareRewards is a web application that incentivizes users to upload screenshot images and engage with content through a dynamic reward system tied to a daily pool fund. The platform is simple, engaging, and designed for viral growth, with rewards distributed based on uploads, likes, and manual tipping. Abuse prevention and fairness are built into the system, making it appealing to a wide audience.
Key Features and Reward System
Image Upload
Description: Users upload screenshot images and provide an XNO wallet address to receive rewards.
Details: 
Optional title or description for context.
No account creation required—only a wallet address is needed.
Each wallet is limited to M eligible uploads per day (e.g., M = 5) to prevent spamming.
Purpose: Encourages content creation with minimal barriers to entry.
Upload Rewards
Description: A portion of the daily pool rewards users for uploading content.
Details:
A fixed percentage U% (e.g., 10%) of the daily pool P XNO is allocated for upload rewards.
This amount (U% × P) is divided equally among all eligible uploads (N) each day.
Reward per upload:
\text{Upload Reward} = \frac{U\% \times P}{N} \text{ XNO}
Only the first M uploads per wallet per day qualify.
Purpose: Motivates participation while curbing excessive uploads.
Image Gallery
Description: A public feed or gallery showcases all uploaded images.
Details: 
Displays like count, "Like" button, and "Tip" button for each image.
Accessible without login.
Purpose: Provides a central space for browsing and interaction.
Liking System
Description: Users can like images to boost their rewards.
Details: 
Requires an XNO wallet address to like (one like per wallet per image).
Prevents abuse by limiting likes to unique wallets.
Purpose: Encourages engagement and rewards popular content.
Like-Based Rewards
Description: The remaining pool funds reward images based on likes.
Details:
(100 - U)% of the daily pool (e.g., 90%) is allocated for like-based rewards.
Distributed proportionally to each image’s like count, with a cap of C% (e.g., 5%) of the like-based pool:
\text{Max Reward per Image} = C\% \times (100 - U)\% \times P \text{ XNO}
Excess rewards beyond the cap are redistributed to other images based on likes.
Calculated and paid out daily.
Purpose: Rewards quality content fairly while preventing domination by a few images.
Manual Tipping
Description: Users can send XNO tips directly to creators.
Details: 
"Tip" button links to a payment page or widget.
Tips go straight to the creator’s XNO wallet.
Purpose: Allows direct support for favorite content.
Sharing Mechanism
Description: Tools to share images on social media.
Details: 
Share buttons for platforms like Twitter, Facebook, etc.
Increases visibility and potential likes.
Purpose: Drives viral growth organically.
Moderation
Description: Ensures content quality and safety.
Details: 
Report button for inappropriate images.
Moderators review and remove flagged content.
Purpose: Maintains a positive user experience.
Technical Requirements
Frontend
Purpose: Delivers a user-friendly interface.
Tech: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (optionally React for dynamism).
Features: 
Upload form for images and wallet address.
Gallery with like, tip, and share options.
Backend
Purpose: Handles data and reward logic.
Tech: Server (e.g., Node.js, Python), database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
Features: 
Stores images, wallet addresses, and like counts.
Tracks daily upload limits per wallet.
Computes and distributes rewards daily.
Manages moderation reports.
XNO Integration
Purpose: Enables reward payouts and tipping.
Details: 
Central XNO wallet for automated rewards.
Secure transactions to user wallets.
Tipping functionality via XNO-compatible widgets.
Security
Purpose: Protects the platform and users.
Details: 
Secure storage of wallet data and XNO keys.
Limits on uploads and likes to prevent abuse.
Moderation for content control.
Example Calculation
Assume:
Daily pool P = 1000 XNO
Upload reward percentage U = 10%
Like-based reward cap C = 5%
Max uploads per wallet M = 5
Total eligible uploads N = 100
Total likes = 1000
Upload Rewards:
Pool = 10% of 1000 = 100 XNO
Per upload = 100 / 100 = 1 XNO
Like-Based Rewards:
Pool = 90% of 1000 = 900 XNO
Max per image = 5% of 900 = 45 XNO
Image with 100 likes (10% of total) earns 10% of 900 = 90 XNO, capped at 45 XNO. Excess (45 XNO) redistributes to other images.
Why This Will Go Viral
Dynamic Rewards: Tied to the daily pool, scaling with platform growth.
Fairness: Upload limits and reward caps balance participation.
Simplicity: No accounts or fees—just upload and earn.
Social Integration: Sharing amplifies reach and engagement.
Competition: Like-based rewards with caps encourage quality and fairness.
User Experience
Flow: 
Upload an image with your XNO wallet address and earn upload rewards (if within M limit).
Share it on social media for likes.
Earn like-based rewards (up to the cap) and receive tips.
Ease: No sign-up, intuitive design.
Clarity: Real-time like and reward visibility.
Implementation Readiness
Frontend: Build a responsive interface.
Backend: Set up storage, tracking, and reward logic.
XNO: Integrate with XNO blockchain/API.
Launch: Start with a daily pool (e.g., 1000 XNO) and scale with usage.
ScreenshotShareRewards is ready to launch, offering creators dynamic XNO earnings, users engaging content, and a platform built for viral success.
