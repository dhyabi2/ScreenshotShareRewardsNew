The Self-Sustained Model
1. Initial Setup
Starting Pool: Begin with 10 XNO as the initial reward pool.

Purpose: This fund kickstarts the platform by rewarding early users until the system becomes self-sustaining.
2. Posting Screenshots
Free Posting: Users can share screenshots without an upfront cost, encouraging participation.

Quality Control: To prevent spam, implement:
A daily posting limit (e.g., 3 screenshots per user).

Optional small XNO deposit (refundable) for posting, slashed if content is low-quality or spam, as judged by community or moderators.
3. Upvoting Mechanism
How It Works: Users can upvote screenshots they like by paying a small amount of XNO (e.g., 0.01 XNO per upvote).

Reward Split:
80% (0.008 XNO) goes directly to the screenshot poster as an immediate reward.

20% (0.002 XNO) goes to the reward pool to sustain the system.
Why It Works: Nano’s feeless transactions make microtransactions like upvotes seamless and cost-effective.
4. Reward Distribution
Periodic Rewards: Daily or weekly, distribute a portion of the pool (e.g., 0.1 XNO) to top posters based on the number of upvotes received.

Example: The top 10 posters share the distribution proportionally to their upvotes, incentivizing high-quality content.

Flexibility: Adjust the distribution amount to ensure the pool’s sustainability (e.g., keep outflow less than inflow).
5. Sustainability and Growth
Inflow vs. Outflow: The pool grows if the XNO from upvotes (20% per upvote) exceeds the reward distribution.
Sample Calculation:
100 upvotes/day × 0.01 XNO = 1 XNO total.

0.8 XNO to posters, 0.2 XNO to pool.

Distribute 0.1 XNO from pool.

Net gain: +0.1 XNO/day.
Scalability: With thousands of upvotes, the pool could grow significantly (e.g., 1000 upvotes/day = +1 XNO net gain).

Early Phase: Use the initial 10 XNO to reward users based on quality or engagement until upvote activity ramps up.
6. Additional Revenue Streams
To enhance sustainability and growth:
Premium Features: Offer paid features (in XNO) like:
Boosted visibility for screenshots.

Analytics on screenshot performance.

Exclusive categories or badges.
Donations: Allow users to donate XNO to the pool voluntarily, rewarding donors with recognition (e.g., badges, leaderboard spots).

Partnerships: Collaborate with brands or companies (e.g., game developers) to sponsor contests or pay for screenshot-based promotion, funneling XNO into the pool.
7. Abuse Prevention
Reputation System: Users earn reputation points based on upvote count or content quality, with higher rewards or visibility for high-reputation users.

Moderation: Community or incentivized curators (paid from the pool) flag spam or low-quality content.

Algorithms: Detect duplicates or irrelevant screenshots automatically.
8. Community Engagement
Contests: Host weekly themed screenshot contests (e.g., “Best Gaming Moment”) with bonus XNO rewards from the pool.

Social Integration: Enable sharing screenshots to social media, attracting new users and increasing upvote activity.

Categories/Tags: Organize screenshots (e.g., gaming, art, tutorials) for better discoverability.
How It Becomes Self-Sustained
Cycle of Value: Users post screenshots → others upvote with XNO → posters earn rewards → pool gets replenished → more rewards distributed.

Growth Potential: As the platform gains popularity, increased upvote activity drives pool growth, enabling larger rewards or additional features.

Bootstrap Phase: The initial 10 XNO sustains early rewards, transitioning to the upvote-driven model as adoption grows.
Example Scenario
Day 1: 50 users post screenshots; 200 upvotes occur (2 XNO total).
Posters get 1.6 XNO (80%).

Pool gets 0.4 XNO (20%).

Distribute 0.2 XNO to top posters.

Pool net gain: +0.2 XNO (10 → 10.2 XNO).
Day 100: 5000 upvotes/day (50 XNO total).
Posters get 40 XNO.

Pool gets 10 XNO.

Distribute 5 XNO.

Pool net gain: +5 XNO/day.
